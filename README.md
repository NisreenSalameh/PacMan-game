![Pac-Man game screenshot](images/PacMan%20game.png)

This is a simple implementation of the classic Pac-Man game using HTML5 and JavaScript. The game utilizes the HTML canvas element for rendering graphics.


## How to play
- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to navigate Pac-Man through the maze.
- Eat all the food items to win the game. Beware of the ghosts!
- If a ghost touches Pac-Man, you lose a life. You have 3 lives. Lose all lives, and it's game over.
- The game features multiple levels, increasing in difficulty as you progress.

## Game Features
- Classic Pac-Man and ghost characters.
- Walls and barriers that define the maze layout.
- Food items that Pac-Man needs to eat to win.
- Modals for game start, level transitions, game over, and victory messages.
- Keeps track of the score and remaining lives.
